Muse - Recipe and Drink app

## Muse of Meals

This is an app that helps users when they need inspiration in the kitchen. The user choose a few specfications and the app will provide a random meal, `via yummly api`, and will pair three wines, `via snooth api`. The user can also save a recipe that looks interesting or that they enjoyed cooking.

## Why Muse?

This app was created to encourage people to cook and enjoy the basic pleasures of life, food and wine. Even the best cooks can have moments where they lack inspiration. This is where Muse stands out, it doesn't bombard you with hundreds of recipes, only one. If you like it, cook it! If not, press the next arrow to try a new recipe.

## How to use Muse

From the landing page click the `Get Started` button. Now you will be taken to the main apps page. In the upper right hand corner, you will find a hamburger icon. This will give you the option to find more info on the app, provide feedback to the developers, log in to your account (or sign out), and view your recipe box.
